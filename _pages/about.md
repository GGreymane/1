This page records the story of **G. Greymane** from AntiLand, where he was fortunate enough to a **Pretty Little Nightmare**, the most wonderful girl he could ever imagine in the world from UK. G. Greymane is currently an Engineering graduate student at UVa, but after meeting a Pretty Little Nightmare, all he wants to do is to write poems and play music for her :)

Poems G. Greymane Wrote for Her
------
**Bury Me Beneath The Tree Where Berries are Enternally Red**    
*Bury me under the tree,*   
*Where the berries are eternally red and shiny.*   
*For in its shade, I'll find my peace,*   
*And in its soil, **my pretty nightmares** will never cease.*   


**Carry me to the Blue Ridge Mountains**   
*Carry me to the Blue Ridge Mountains, where the mist veils the land,*    
*Where solitude reigns supreme, and nature's beauty is at hand.*    
*There, beneath the shadow of the peaks, I'll find my place,*    
*And with my **pretty little nightmire**, I'll lose myself in endless space.*    


**In a Tunnel Long and Dark**    
...
*How can I bear this agony so intense?*   
*Only through DEATH!*    
*From which my **pretty little nightmare** grows.*
